<h1>
    Part 9: TypeScript
</h1>

<p>
    This part is all about TypeScript: an open-source typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that compiles to plain JavaScript.<br><br>
    In this part, we will be using the tools previously introduced to build end-to-end features to an existing ecosystem, with predefined linters and an existing codebase, while writing TypeScript. After doing this part, you should be able to understand, develop and configure projects using TypeScript.<br><br>
    This part is created by Tuomo Torppa, Tuukka Peuraniemi and Jani Rapo, the awesome developers of Terveystalo, the largest private healthcare service provider in Finland. Terveystaloâ€™s nationwide network covers 300 locations across Finland. The clinic network is supplemented by 24/7 digital services.<br><br>
